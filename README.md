## My Super Secret Car Collection Website (MSSCCW)
https://a2-natdynko.glitch.me/

For this assignment, I followed the themeing of the starter code and created a car storage website that lets you store what cars you have. It also calculates what the estimated End Of Life year will be given its age and Average Miles Per Gallon (not accurate).   
## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: With some JavaScript, I was able to dynamically create an HTML element (a table) and automatically inject values into it. The only issue with this design is that it does not allow for repeated input or deletion of data without refreshing the page first.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: The primary 3 forms take in the model, year, and mpg of a car. It then returns the what is stored on the server in response with the newly added data, plus  a newly created column. In this new column, the estimated End Of Life for the car is calculated. 

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I did not perform the Think Aloud Protocol or interview any of my classmates.
- **Design Achievement 2**: Although very simple, all of the elements of the page are centered and aligned correctly. It also all takes place in a single-page app, which ties into the issue discussed in Tech Achievement 1. 
- **Design Achievement 3**: All of the text on the page utilizes Google Fonts.
